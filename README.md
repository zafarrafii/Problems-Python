## 01. Find longest word in dictionary that is a subsequence of a given string

From [Google](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/find-longest-word-in-dictionary-that-subsequence-of-given-string/#code-challenge)

 Given a string ``S`` and a set of words ``D``, find the longest word in ``D`` that is a subsequence of ``S``.

Word ``W`` is a subsequence of ``S`` if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from ``S`` to form ``W``, without reordering the remaining characters.

Note: ``D`` can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.)

For example, given the input of ``S = "abppplee"`` and ``D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"}`` the correct output would be "apple"

- The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
- The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.
- The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.
