    "Given an integer array with **even** length, where different numbers in this array represent different **kinds** of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies **equally** in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of **kinds** of candies the sister could gain.\n",

    "**Example 1**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.\n",
    "Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. \n",

    "Explanation: For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1]. \n",
    "The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies. \n",
