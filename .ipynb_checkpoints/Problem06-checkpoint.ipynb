    "Imagine an island that is in the shape of a bar graph. When it rains, certain areas of the island fill up with rainwater to form lakes. Any excess rainwater the island cannot hold in lakes will run off the island to the west or east and drain into the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of positive integers representing 2-D bar heights, design an algorithm (or write a function) that can compute the total volume (capacity) of water that could be held in all lakes on such an island given an array of the heights of the bars. Assume an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Given ``[1,3,2,4,1,3,1,4,5,2,2,1,4,2,2]``, return ``15`` (3 bodies of water with volumes of 1,7,7 yields total volume of 15)\n",

    "The idea here is to loop over the unique values in the array (in ascending order), find the first and last indices in the array corresponding to each unique value, and update the array by replacing the values in the interval spanned by these indices by the unique value if the values are smaller. Each time, you will also update an initialized total volume by adding to it the corresponding difference of values.\n",

You loop over the array between these indices and check where the values in that interval are less than ``1``. In this case, no value is less than ``1`` in that interval.\n",

You loop over the array between these indices and check where the values in that interval are less than ``2``. In this case, the values at indices ``4``, ``6``, and ``11`` are ``1`` which is less than ``2``. You then update the total volume from ``0`` to ``3`` (plus 3 times 1 unit). You also update the array by changing the values at these indices to ``2``.\n",

    "The next unique value is ``3``. The first and last indices corresponding to ``3`` in the array are ``1`` and ``5``, respectively.

In this case, the values at indices ``2`` and ``4`` are ``2`` which is less than ``3``. You then update the initialized total volume from ``3`` to ``5`` (plus 2 times 1 unit).
