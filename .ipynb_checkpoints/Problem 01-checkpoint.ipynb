    "**The Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string ``S`` and a set of words ``D``, find the longest word in ``D`` that is a subsequence of ``S``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word ``W`` is a subsequence of ``S`` if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from ``S`` to form ``W``, without reordering the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: ``D`` can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the input of ``S = \"abppplee\"`` and ``D = {\"able\", \"ale\", \"apple\", \"bale\", \"kangaroo\"}`` the correct output would be ``\"apple\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "- The words \"able\" and \"ale\" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than \"apple\".\n",
    "- The word \"bale\" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.\n",
    "- The word \"kangaroo\" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question gives you the chance to practice with algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s also a good example of why careful analysis for Big-O performance is often worthwhile, as is careful exploration of common and worst-case input conditions."
