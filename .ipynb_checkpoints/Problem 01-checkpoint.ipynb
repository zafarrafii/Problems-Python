    "Given a string ``S`` and a set of words ``D``, find the longest word in ``D`` that is a subsequence of ``S``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word ``W`` is a subsequence of ``S`` if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from ``S`` to form ``W``, without reordering the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: ``D`` can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the input of ``S = \"abppplee\"`` and ``D = {\"able\", \"ale\", \"apple\", \"bale\", \"kangaroo\"}`` the correct output would be ``\"apple\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "- The words \"able\" and \"ale\" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than \"apple\".\n",
    "- The word \"bale\" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.\n",
    "- The word \"kangaroo\" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.\n",

    "The idea here is to loop over each word in the set, and for each word, loop over the characters in the string, check if the current character in the string matches the current character in the current word - if so, count it - and then move forward in the word until the end of the string or the end of the word has been reached; in the latter case, we will then break the loop over the characters in the string. Once we have counted the number of characters in the string which appears in the words, we zero any number which is shorter than the length of the corresponding word as this means that the whole word does not appear in the string so it is therefore not a subsequence of the string. We finally return the word with the longest number of characters appearing in the string."
