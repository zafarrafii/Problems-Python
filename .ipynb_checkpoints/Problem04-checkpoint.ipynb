    "Given an integer array with **even** length, where different numbers in this array represent different **kinds** of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies **equally** in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of **kinds** of candies the sister could gain.\n",

    "There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.\n",

    "The idea here is to have a simple class (without a constructor) with a static method (without a self) which will just check how many unique values are in the array, which basically correspond to the different kinds of candies. We then check if that number is equal, greater, or less than half the length of the array (which should be even), which corresponds to the number of candies the sister (and also the brother) should get:\n",
